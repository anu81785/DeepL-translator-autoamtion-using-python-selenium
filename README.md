# python-selenium-translator
This is a script written in python using selenium library to automate translation from german to english. The DeepL translator is used  for translation, which takes only 5000 characters at a time. It also does not remove the '-' character from the end of each line which changes the meaning of word after translation. With this script, the '-' character will be automatically removed from the end of each line and one can add as much as data in a file in small paragraphs to translate the whole thing at once rather than translating only 5000 characters at a time.
